Problem Explanation
You are given a list prices representing the price of an asset over years.

Goal
Find the minimum loss if:

You buy in an earlier year (i)

And sell in a later year (j)

Only consider transactions where price[j] < price[i]

 Logic Breakdown

for i in range(len(prices)):
    for j in range(i + 1, len(prices)):
Check all future prices for each year.


if prices[j] < prices[i]:
    loss = prices[i] - prices[j]
Calculate loss only if selling price is lower.


if loss < min_loss:
    min_loss = loss
    buy = i + 1
    sell = j + 1
Track the minimum possible loss and corresponding buy/sell years (1-indexed).

 Input
python
Copy
Edit
prices = [20, 15, 7, 2, 13]
 Output
Buy Year: 1
Sell Year: 2
Loss: 5
Buy at 20 (Year 1), Sell at 15 (Year 2)

Minimum possible loss: 5
